Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

## What have you done for your project so far?

- At the moment, we have completed getting images for characters and backgrounds. We have also made a start page. In other words, we have gotten the artwork required for the storyline located in the image folder via Renpy. 
- For the characters, we decided to create our own using a website that allows us to generate our own anime characters. 
- For our backgrounds, we will be using Google images and our own drawings. 
- For our start page/GUI, we do not have a final copy just yet. Since it is the first impression for the users/gamers, we want to make a good impression and have the characteristics of the game to be what we want for it, mysterious and fun. 

## What have you not done for your project yet?

- We are still currently creating the chronological order of the storyline and the character's choices. We still need to figure out how to allow the user/gamer to make the decisions and have a variety of options for them to survive the game. 
- We are also need to figure out how to add sounds for the gameplay.

## What problems, if any, have you encountered?

- We are having problems with transition and like we stated above, how to allow the user/gamer to make decisions with different inputs. 
- We have also encountered an error of the deletion of our repository. With Professor Rosen's help, we were able to recover our project.
- We have also created a clone of the repository in the meantime for future unexpected events.
