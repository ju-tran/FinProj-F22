One thing I wanted to include was another last minute challenge we faced. Right before uploading and one last runthrough of the game, one of the character's dialogue text turned black, and it would not revert back to the default white color no matter what I tried. I found this strange because every other runthrough beforehand was completely fine. We tried to overcome it by making it a part of our game but overall that is not how we wanted it to go. However we just continued through it since we tried everything we could think of.
