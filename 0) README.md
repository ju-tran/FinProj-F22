- You donâ€™t know how many tutorials we went through. It was tough, but worth learning how to use Renpy. 

- One thing I wanted to include was another last minute challenge we faced. Right before uploading and one last runthrough of the game, one of the character's dialogue text turned black, and it would not revert back to the default white color no matter what I tried. I found this strange because every other runthrough beforehand was completely fine. We tried to overcome it by making it a part of our game but overall that is not how we wanted it to go. However we just continued through it since we tried everything we could think of. 

- We learned how easy it is to create and write visual novels. It allowed us to storytell and create mini challenges. Specifically, I learned the different fonts that are available to us via Renpy and I also learned how to add sound effects and background music.
